# Welcome to IND2063-M1L3!
Hello there. This is a simple code for [blocking certain contents inside a message](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Message.content) made using the discord.py module available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)

Thanks! Please feel free to change this code to your needs.
